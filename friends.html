    I got four crazy friends. Friends to never loose. 
</p>
<p>
    <h2>IAN GITONGA NGATIA </h2>
    He is popularly known as <i>Mhenga</i>. He happens to be my classmate. He is my shortest friend and sometimes gets mad at me when i call him a dwarf. <br>
    He is good poet and his role model is Tear Drops.
</p>
<p>
    <h2>ERICK KAMAU MACHARIA </h2>
    Erick is crazy by nature. We got many things in common which I guess are the reasons for our friendship. We got some good and bad memories that are <br>
    part of our lives. Eric is a talk dirty buddy. He is also open.
</p>

    <h2>STEPHEN RANJI KAE </h2>
    He has been my roommate since the year 2016. He is a GEGIS student current in third year. This dude know much about me and I cant afford loosing him. <br>
