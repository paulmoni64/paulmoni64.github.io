<H1>MY HOBBY</H1>
<p>
    Every one of us has some kind of liking/ disliking for certain things in life. Similarly I love drawing because drawing do not cost much and is always fun.<br>
    Drawing is my favorite hobby.
</p>
<p>
    I cannot imagine a colorful life without drawing. My greatest inspiration is my mother who always encourages me to design her dresses. It is my believe <br>
    that to display your art you do not have to be a great artist.
</p>
<p>
    You just have to make a unique piece. So get your paint brush and pencil and start drawing.
</p>
<p>
    When I am blue I cheer myself up by drawing something so that I can make myself happy. Drawing is a way for me to show my creativity. However drawing is<br> 
    not as easy as it seems to be. It needs a lot of devotion as well as practice. I can never feel bored when I have my colors with me. My colors are my best<br>
    friend.
</p>
<p>
    I like drawing since I was 6 years old. I like to make unrealistic things look realistic through drawing. Drawing is the perfect way to make things look <br>
    alive. I imagine all kinds of strange things to show it on a piece of paper such as hell & demons, a beautiful house in heaven etc.

</p>
<p>
    I have decorated my house with lot of my drawings. Every year I gift my grandparents and parents with my drawing on their anniversaries because they are <br>
    very fond of my drawings and always encourage me to practice more. Drawing has now become the most important part of my life. But most of the times I am <br>
    unable to take out much time due to my studies and social life. But still I manage to take out sometime and practice to improve my drawing.
</p>
<p>
    The most attractive and unique part of my drawing is the concept of demons and horror. I love to choose these unique concepts because they look weird and<br>
    scare people sometimes. My leisure hours are always occupied to my drawing paper, pen and brush.
</p>
<p>
    The strangest thing about my hobby is that nobody taught me how to paint. Even when I was in school drawing was not my subject. I learnt it by myself and <br>
    later got inspiration by my parents. I learnt few concepts through text book containing different types of sketches. I have always intimated everything <br>
    from those books such as rivers, hills, trees, human faces, clouds and animals. With days my drawing improved step by steps & is still improving. <br>
    I constantly make efforts to retain my hobby.
